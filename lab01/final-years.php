        <h2>Junior and Senior Year</h2>
        <p>Junior year had me taking Heat and Mass Transfer, Separation Process, Thermodynamics 1, Reactor Design, Polymer Synthesis, Social Psychology, Writing as a Professional, and Junior ChemE Lab. This year, a lot of the Chemical Engineering classes just poured on, but I was more ready compared to the previous year just because of the trials I went through sophomore year. Polymer Synthesis, while technically the hardest was my most enjoyed. Heat and Mass and Reactor Design were also surprisingly more enjoyable than previously expected. Junior lab was the most difficult for sure as it had the most grunt work and hours to dedicate. That leads to senior year, in which so far I've had Senior Design, Introduction to Web Design, Web Programming, Process Design, and Thermodynamics 2. This final semester, it's going to be Process Control, Introduction to Media Studies, Advanced Front End Development, and Mobile App Design. It has been a long, arduous journey, but I truly believed each of these courses has helped me grow into the person I am today, so I'm eager to see how this semester will help me continue that growth.
