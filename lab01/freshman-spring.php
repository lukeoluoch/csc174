        <h2>Freshman Spring</h2>
        <p>
                The spring had me taking Chemical Process Analysis, Self-Paced Mechanical Physics, Organic Chemistry 2, Linear Algebra and differential equations, and a writing class based on intelligent machines in popular media. I think I grew the most as a person in Physics as it helped me learn my own personal strengths and weaknesses when it came to learning material all on my own. Linear Algebra was my least favorite as it gave me the first example of how a course with manageable content can be ruined by a professor whose style doesnâ€™t work for you. It was quite the struggle, and it acquainted me with the trials I would experience more of in the future.
