                Freshman year was a year that was entered eagerly and somewhat unprepared with. In the fall, I ended up taking Introduction to the Art of Film, Organic Chemistry 1, Multivariable Calculus and Green Energy, the introductory chemical engineering class. Of the four, I have to say I enjoyed Organic Chemistry the most mostly because even though the professor we had was relatively new to the area, he taught with a real energy and passion that was inspiring. Not to mention the lab was pretty eye opening. Calculus was difficult but stimulating and because of my professor doing a great job teaching, I enjoyed it. Film was nice, but I realized that parts of it weren't for me. While I enjoyed analysis of Blade Runner and Rear Window, some movies seems experimentally weird for the sake of being so and I couldn't get fully behind that. Green energy was alright but a little bit too disarming as it made me think all ChemE classes going forward would be that same difficulty.
